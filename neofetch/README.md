### How do I use this config ðŸ¤” ?

Once neofetch is installed copy the **config.conf** contents into your neofetch config folder.

>* The config folder is generally located in **~/.config** unless your distro is wierdly configured.
>* Neofetch will look for its config in the **.config/neofetch/config.conf** file. 
>* The config directory is **hidden** by default and you might need to create the **neofetch folder** in it with the file **config.conf**.

### Troubles with displaying image ðŸ˜° ?
>* Make sure that w3m is installed in your system. w3m is essential as it serves as a backend to display the image.
