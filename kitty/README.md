### How do I use this config?

Once kitty is installed copy the **kitty.conf** contents into your config folder.

>* The config folder is generally located in **~/.config** usless your distro is wierdly configured.
>* Kitty will look for its config in the **.config/kitty/kitty.conf**. 
>* The config directory is **hidden** by default and you need to create the **kitty folder** in it with the file **kitty.conf**.
