### How do I use this config ðŸ¤” ?

Once kitty is installed copy the **kitty.conf** contents into your kitty config folder.

>* The config folder is generally located in **~/.config** unless your distro is wierdly configured.
>* Kitty will look for its config in the **.config/kitty/kitty.conf** file. 
>* The config directory is **hidden** by default and you need to create the **kitty folder** in it with the file **kitty.conf**.
